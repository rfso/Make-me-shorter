#  Make me shorter (Url Shortener)

⚠️⚠️WARNING⚠️⚠️ The API that I've decided to use is DEAD. I'm searching for a new one.

##  Full Access

* [Make me shorter](https://make-me-shorter.vercel.app/)


##  General info
- **About the code:** Well, the main idea was to keep everything as simple and organized as I could. So, I tried to follow a clear and straightforward naming convention, taking into account all React good practices.

- **About the versioning/commits:** I'm not really using any sort of convention (even though it looks similar to conventional commits ([https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)). It's just a way to keep things a little bit organized/readable.
